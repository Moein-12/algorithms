# Algorithms  
**Code Playground | Python Experiments**  

---

### **What’s Here**  
A collection of algorithm implementations focusing on:  
- **Standard Implementations**: Classic textbook approaches.  
- **Custom Variants**: Tweaks for specific use cases.  
- **Experimental Features**: Unconventional optimizations or control flows.  
- **Low-Level Control**: Manual array/memory operations where Python allows.  
- **Extensible Design**: Parameterized functions for reuse (e.g., custom comparators).  
- **Clean Code**: Type hints, docstrings, and modular structure.  
- **No external dependencies** — built purely with Python 3.10’s standard library.  

---

### **Why Bother?**  
- Explores Python’s limits for algorithmic control (despite its inherent slowness).  
- A sandbox for testing edge cases, optimizations, and “what if?” scenarios.

### **Setup**  
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/algorithms.git  
cd algorithms  
```

### **Future Plans**  
If you come across a skeleton file with functions or class methods that raise `NotImplementedError`, that's probably the next thing on the roadmap.

### **License**  
[MIT License](LICENSE) — Do whatever, but no guarantees.

### **Note**  
This project grows organically. Files may appear broken or empty — that’s intentional. It’s a playground, not a promise.
